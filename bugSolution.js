```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Some content here -->
</div>
```
This version uses an additional color (`via-purple-500`) to ensure the gradient completely covers the element.  Alternative solutions could include setting a default background color with `bg-gray-100`, for instance, or directly using CSS's `linear-gradient` for more precise control.
